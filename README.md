# CIS 465 Final Deliverable
A collection of various works using ASP.Net and Python. The goal was to use these powerful frameworks to create various web apps.

## Getting Started:
Here are the presquisites to get the projects running:  

 * Python3 needs to be installed
 * The webframework Django needs to be installed
 * Virtualenv needs to be installed
 * Visual Studio needs to be installed to run the ASP.Net programs

## The ASP.Net_work folder:

A group of different web apps that I learned are placed here. There is a web authenticator, an API, a movie ticket reserver, and file to be uploaded to Azure.

## The python_work folder:
A group of small projects to learn various concepts in Python. This folder contains my first major project in Python which is my data visualization. I used pygal to visualize various csv and json files for scientific, business, or educational purposes.

## The learning_logs folder:
A project that used Django to create a blog style website that allows users to record subjects they have learned. I have used Heroku to upload my web application. Here is the link to my learning_log <http://mylearning-log.herokuapp.com/>

## Built with:
* The Sublime text editor
* Visual Studio 2015
